                    MonStore is a place where you can find your favorite videogames (or discover new ones) and see the information available about them.
                    Here, you can find videos, images, ratings, and links to where to buy them, their official sites, or even their communities.

                    MonStore was developed by Juan Cruz Montiel, me.
                    I'm a self-taught web developer who loves programming. I really like creating websites, but that's not the only thing I like to do: I want to create my very own videogame and other useful and fun applications. If you want to know what I'm working on right now, check mi GitHub <a href="https://github.com/TatuMon/MonStore.git" class="text-link">here<a>.
